# Plant-Based Buds
This is a website built with Python and Flask that aims to help teach users about great sources of plant-based nutrition.

## Motivation
There is a common misconception that people who eat plant-based diets cannot possibly eat enough protein to survive. There are also people that want to eat less meat for a variety of reasons (personal health, animal rights, environmental sustainability, etc.) but don't know where to start. This website has been designed to take input from the user to provide a recommendation for daily protein intake and also allows users to select a nutrient, which will then display a table filled with plant-based foods with high levels of the nutrient selected. Hopefully, this website can help users make more knowledgeable decisions when it comes to the foods that they eat.
